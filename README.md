## 📘 Overview

This project investigates the development of a **Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN)** for **robust fake news detection** across multiple domains. The central aim is to enhance the model's **semantic generalization** ability, enabling it to identify fake news not only in a specific dataset or domain but also across diverse topics (e.g., healthcare, politics and entertainment).

The architecture incorporates **Multi-Domain Learning** and **Adversarial Invariance Techniques**, with extensive comparisons to other machine learning and deep learning baselines—including **Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression**, and **Large Language Models**.

## 🧠 Core Contributions

- Implementation of a **Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN)** with a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL)
- Benchmarking against **SVM, Logistic Regression, kNN**, and **LLMs (Transformer-based models)**
- Integration of **domain-specific data** from various public datasets
- Usage of **data augmentation** and **data balancing**
- Performance evaluation across metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and computational efficiency

## 📦 Get the Data

Retrieving data can be done in **4 different ways**, depending on how much control you want over the data acquisition process:

### 🗂️ Use the Preprocessed All-in-One File

Use the fully processed, combined dataset available in the `/pipeline` directory.  
- The file has been either processed directly or additionally augmented before processing.
- Load them using: `read_processed_data()` (from `common_functions.py`)
- Downloadable via `download_processed_data.py` in `/pipeline`.
- This is the quickest and easiest option — no setup required.



### 🧩 Use the Individual Processed Files

Available in the `/datasets` directory: `real.parquet` and `fake.parquet`.

- Slightly preprocessed data, split into real and fake news.
- Generated by running `process_dataset.ipynb` on the raw data.
- Load them using:
  - `read_dataset()` for individual files (from `common_functions.py`)
  - `read_all_datasets()` to load all at once (from `common_functions.py`)
- Downloadable via `download_datasets.py` in `/datasets`.



### 📁 Use the Raw Parquet Datasets

Located in `/prepare_datasets` — mostly raw `.parquet` files converted from original sources.

- Created by executing `make_dataset.ipynb`.
- Requires further processing using `process_dataset.ipynb`.
- Downloadable via `download_raw_datasets.py` in `/prepare_datasets`.



### 🌐 Download from Original Sources

Get the original datasets directly from the official sources listed above.

- After downloading, run `make_dataset.ipynb` and then `process_dataset.ipynb` for full preparation.
- Furthermore, this data should run through the processing and augmentation pipeline found in the pipeline folder
